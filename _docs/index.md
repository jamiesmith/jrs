This site has been a long time coming.  I think that I was waiting for the right technology to come along.  Something geeky enough to be cool, but not so mainstream that it required extra work.  I deal with computer stuff all day, every day, so I wasn't looking for something that was going to require a robust devops toolchain.  Jekyll seemed to be the right balance of cool and easy.  Strangely, the theme that I liked the best out of all of them was actually Jekyll's own theme, so I leveraged it, leaving the license in place.

## What will I find on this site?

Wow, honestly I don't even know yet.  There are many things that I have squirreled away in evernote docs which will likely get migrated here.
You create your content as text files ([Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.

Jekyll happens to be the engine behind [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers **for free**.
